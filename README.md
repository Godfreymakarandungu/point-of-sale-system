# point-of-sale-system
UCSM Point of Sale System is aimed for small convenience stores which are still unfamiliar to computerized system of running the business. This system is simple yet effective as the functions are easy to use for the users, that is, for the store owner or store manager and store cashiers.

In the admin panel, there are fields which are effective for the administration of the whole store. The admin can manage list of product items, product categories, cashier information, customer information and supplier information.

In the cashier panel, the user will be provided with interfaces to sell items to customers. He/she can search the selling items by barcode or item-name. The cashier can also redeem the payment card or create new cards.

In card, we put each card’s QR-code. We included this function because we believe that the card payment system is more convenient than the cash payment. Cashless made effortless.

This project is implemented with Model–view–controller (MVC) software design pattern.
